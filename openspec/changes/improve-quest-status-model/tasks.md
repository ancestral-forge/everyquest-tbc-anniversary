## 1. Work State and Contract

- [x] 1.1 Confirm the clean `fix-quest-status-model` worktree, current `origin/main` merge base, issue #31 scope, and relevant addon-runtime and quest-status specs with git and OpenSpec status output.

## 2. Status Model and Lifecycle

- [x] 2.1 Implement mutually exclusive stored statuses, legacy abandoned-record interpretation, and Clear Status, verified by `tools/test-quest-status-model.lua` under Lua 5.1.
- [x] 2.2 Update row labels, tooltip/menu terminology, lifecycle precedence, localization, and changelog text, verified by the status-model and context-menu regression tests.

## 3. Skipped Chain Detection

- [x] 3.1 Derive Unavailable from a later active or completed quest while preserving manual and lifecycle overrides, verified by `tools/test-quest-chain-status.lua`.
- [x] 3.2 Guard optional Questie module access, validate returned quest IDs, and cache only valid relationships, verified by disabled/error/nil/garbage fault-injection cases.

## 4. Local Validation

- [x] 4.1 Run `tools/verify-addon.sh` successfully after implementation and retain its Lua 5.1, Luacheck, XML, TOC, whitespace, and regression-test evidence.
- [x] 4.2 Run `openspec validate --all` successfully and inspect the complete `origin/main...HEAD` diff for scope and compatibility.

## 5. Delivery and Runtime Evidence

- [ ] 5.1 Verify accept, complete, turn-in, abandon, fail, clear, simultaneous-chain, skipped-chain, and faulty/disabled Questie behavior in the live TBC Anniversary client with script errors enabled.
- [ ] 5.2 Push `fix-quest-status-model` and create a draft pull request to `main` with `Closes #31`, then verify the remote head SHA and issue linkage.
- [ ] 5.3 Verify the pull request's remote CI result separately from local and live-client evidence.
